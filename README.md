## Database Setup

##Getting Started
 node js

##Prerequisites
 Node.js -- (https://nodejs.org/en/) Code editor Installing Download project with git clone npm install killall node if necessary npm run server on one terminal npm run client on one terminal

##Setup All data is stored in an array on the server.

Running the server code requires nodemon. If you don't already have nodemon, install it globally with npm install nodemon --global.

npm install npm run server

Now that the server is running, open a new terminal tab with cmd + t and start the react client app.

npm run client

Between the server and client, you'll need two terminal tabs! Because we're using nodemon, both our client side and server side will automatically spin back up when changes are made!
